# Seed Hypermedia

> “A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted.”

A seed’s coating protects its genetic information — sometimes for centuries — until the optimal moment to sprout. It’s a possibility — for growth, for life, for connection, to spread, change minds and shape the future — preserved. Blockchain technologies leverage a unique, twelve-word “seed phrase” as the basis for a trusted record.
Seed Hypermedia marries cryptographic signatures with a promise from the past: a publishing platform with fine-grained linking and embedding capabilities. By coupling decentralized technology with content distribution, Seed Hypermedia allows creators and moderators to collaborate while retaining authorship rights and offer their audiences and communities the interactivity of social media in an environment they curate and control. 
## What makes us different? 
As a publishing and collaboration tool, Seed Hypermedia is: 

**Decentralized**: With the peer-to-peer infrastructure and integrated Bitcoin lightning payments, no central authority can regulate content, or your ability to monetize it. 

**Deeply Linked**: The link is the engine of collaborative thought. Fine-grained linking and embedding offer the interactivity of social media, while cryptographic signatures create permanent records that you can trust. 

**Open**: Our open source protocol and transparent practices enable creators, developers, and moderators to build collaborative communities you control, outside of social media gatekeepers.
